          <b>Preah Khan</b> (Khmer: ប្រាសាទព្រះខ័ន; "RoyalSword") is a temple at
          Angkor, Cambodia, built in the 12th century for King Jayavarman VII to
          honor his father. It is located northeast of Angkor Thomand just west
          of the Jayatataka baray, with which it was associated. It was the
          centre of a substantial organization, with almost 100,000 officials
          and servants. The temple is flat in design, with a basic plan of
          successive rectangulargalleries around a Buddhist sanctuary
          complicated by Hindu satellite temples and numerous later additions.
          Like the nearby Ta Prohm, Preah Khan has been left largely unrestored,
          with numerous trees and other vegetation growing among the ruins.
          Preah Khan was built on the site of Jayavarman VII's victory over the
          invading Chams in 1191. Unusually the modern name, meaning "holy
          sword", is derived from the meaning of the original—Nagara Jayasri
          (holy city of victory). The site may previously have been occupied by
          the royal palaces of Yasovarman II and Tribhuvanadityavarman.

          The temple's foundation stela has provided considerable information
          about the history and administration of the site: the main image, of
          the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvarain the form of the king's father, was
          dedicated in 1191 (the king's mother had earlier been commemorated in
          the same way at Ta Prohm). 430 other deities also had shrines on the
          site, each of which received an allotment of food, clothing,perfume
          and even mosquito nets; the temple's wealth included gold,
          silver,gems, 112,300 pearls and a cow with gilded horns. The
          institution combined the roles of city, temple and Buddhist
          university: there were 97,840 attendants and servants, including 1000
          dancers and 1000 teachers.
